Our two agents are both able to see the open tickets using our osTicket platform. From there, they can set the properties of the ticket depnding on the impact of the business. We use agent John to respond to user Karen and help her resolve the issues.

For this ticket, we can change the SLA to Sev-A since there is an critical business outage. We assign it to the online banking team. We also change the help topic to critical business outage.

Agents have to respond to these tickets and update the users depending on the SLA. Once they solve the issue, they can change the status of the ticket to resolved.
